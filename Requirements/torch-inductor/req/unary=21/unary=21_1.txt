The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = torch.tanh(t1) # Apply the hyperbolic tangent function to the output of the convolution
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is passed through a hyperbolic tangent activation function.
