The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int z = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable z

    // define a loop with a single latch
    while (x CONDITION y) {
        RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here with x, y, z
        x = x OPERATOR ANY_VALUE; // x is updated in each iteration
        if (z CONDITION ANY_VALUE) {
            break; // a break statement with a condition that can be constant folded
        }
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop with a single latch. The loop condition involves a comparison (`CONDITION`) between two variables `x` and `y`. Inside the loop, there is a `break` statement with a condition that can be constant folded. The `x` variable is updated in each iteration. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
