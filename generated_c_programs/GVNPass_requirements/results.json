The program you generate should be compilable with GCC, clang and Clang. \n\n## Requirements for GCC\n\nYour generated C program should compile and execute correctly using GCC. You can find the correct compilation command by running:\n```bash\ngcc -O3 file_name.c -o executable_file_name\n```\nYou may need to adjust the `-O` optimization flag depending on your system configuration. The above is the exact command you will need when generating a C program for GCC and can be used as an example to generate other GCC commands that will execute the same program. \n\n## Requirements for Clang \n\nYour generated C program should compile and execute correctly using clang. You can find the correct compilation command by running:\n```bash\nclang -O3 file_name.c -o executable_file_name\n```\nYou may need to adjust the `-O` optimization flag depending on your system configuration.
