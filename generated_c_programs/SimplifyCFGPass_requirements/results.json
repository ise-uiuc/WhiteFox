            "raw": "\nPlease generate a valid C program that meets the requirements above. The generated program should contain a `main` function which returns an integer value (i.e., it must end with `return` statement). Please initialize all variables you define with a value, including those declared as global. You may omit any undefined behavior in your code.\n\nFor simplicity, this problem doesn't require you to handle multiple data types (integers and floating-point numbers), but if the C compiler supports it you can also generate programs that use pointers. If you don't know how to properly initialize pointers, please do not worry about it as long as you are careful when calling other functions with pointer arguments.\n\n# Grading\n\nThe total score for this problem is **0**. You must use your generated C program to verify the correctness of your program in a test bench (you can submit your program to an online judge system). The maximum score for this assignment is 5 points, including all tests you pass. If you submit code that doesn't compile and passes the tests, then the grade will be reduced by 0.25 each time it fails.\n\n## Output of testing (for grading)\n\nWhen compiling your generated C program, you need to generate an executable binary file from the source code. For instance, if you are on a Mac or Linux terminal and execute the following command in your current directory:\n\n```bash\n$ gcc test_main.c -o test_main # compile with gcc compiler\n```\n\nOn Windows, just replace `gcc` by `cc`. You can either download an IDE (e.g., Microsoft Visual Studio), or you can use the [MinGW](https://www.mingw.org/) cross-compiler to generate executables for testing. If you are using the MinGW compiler, please make sure that it has been added to your path environment variable first. The command line example is as follows:\n\n```bash\n$ cc test_main.c -o test_main # compile with MinGW compiler\n```\n\nThe output will be similar to this one:\n\n```bash\ntest_main.c: In function 'main':\ntest_main.c:3:5: warning: implicit declaration of function\n  'function_with_branches' [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]\n    result = function_with_branches(x  >  5);\n     ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\ntest_main.c:6:10: note: in expansion of macro\n  'FUNCTION_WITH_BRANCHES'\n   return FUNCTION_WITH_BRANCHES(condition, x  >  5);\n          ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n```\n\nAfter compiling and running the program, you can get an output like this one:\n\n```bash\n$ ./test_main # execute the executable binary file (without parameters) from\n  current directory\n10\n$ ./test_main 2 # execute with a parameter (2)\n50\n$ ./test_main x > 3 # execute with an invalid input value\n10\n$ ./test_main -x > 3 # execute with an invalid parameter\n./test_main: line 6:  7499 Segmentation fault      ./test_main -x >\n  3\n```\n\nIf you are using the IDE (or your favorite compiler), please make sure that you have generated a binary file when compiling it. Otherwise, after generating it in your terminal, you will need to run the executable with `./test_main` as an argument to execute it. You can also generate and test multiple versions of the program by changing certain parameters in the C source code.\n",
