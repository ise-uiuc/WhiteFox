The C++ code should contain the following pattern:

```cpp
int main() {
    int array1[ANY_SIZE]; // Declare an array
    int array2[ANY_SIZE]; // Declare another array
    int i;

    // First loop
    for (i = 0; i < ANY_SIZE; i++) {
        array1[i] = ANY_EXPRESSION; // Perform some operation on array1
    }

    // Second loop
    for (i = 0; i < ANY_SIZE; i++) {
        array2[i] = ANY_EXPRESSION; // Perform some operation on array2
    }

    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exist two separate loops that iterate over two different arrays (`array1` and `array2`). The loops must be separate and not nested within each other. The size of the arrays and the number of iterations in the loops (`ANY_SIZE`) must be the same. The operations performed on the arrays within the loops (`ANY_EXPRESSION`) can be any valid C++ expressions. The `main` function must return an integer value. 

This pattern is likely to trigger the `LoopFusePass` optimization in LLVM, as it involves two separate loops that could potentially be fused together for performance improvement.
