The C code should contain the following pattern:

```c
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    while (x CONDITION y) {
        RANDOM_CODE; // Do something here, but don't modify x and y
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a loop with a condition that is invariant, i.e., the variables involved in the condition (`x` and `y` in this case) are not modified within the loop. The loop body can contain any code (`RANDOM_CODE`), as long as it does not modify `x` and `y`. The `CONDITION` can be any comparison operator, such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
