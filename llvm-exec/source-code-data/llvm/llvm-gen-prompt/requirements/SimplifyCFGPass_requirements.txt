### Please generate a valid C program that meets the requirements below. The program should contain a `main` function that returns an integer value. Please initialize all variables you define with a value. Please do not include any undefined behavior in your code. The code you generate will be used to test the correctness of the optimization.

# Description of requirements

The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
// Template for CFG simplification
int function_with_branches(int condition) {
    int result = 0;
    
    // Control flow that could be simplified
    if (condition) {
        result = 10;
    } else {
        result = 10;  // Same value as the true branch
    }
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int result = function_with_branches(x > 5);
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where the control flow graph can be simplified without changing program behavior, such as removing redundant branches or merging identical code paths
