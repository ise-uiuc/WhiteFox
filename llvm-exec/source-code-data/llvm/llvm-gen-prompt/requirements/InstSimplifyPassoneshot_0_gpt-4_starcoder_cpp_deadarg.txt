The C code should contain the following pattern:

```c
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int z = x + y; // perform some operation
    if (z == x + y) { // compare the result with the same operation
        // do something
    }
    return 0;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists a computation (in this case, `x + y`), and the result of this computation is being used in a comparison with the same computation. The `if` statement is redundant because it is comparing the result of a computation with the same computation, which will always be true. The variables `x` and `y` can be any type that supports the `+` operator and the `==` operator, e.g., `int`, `float`, `double`, etc. The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
