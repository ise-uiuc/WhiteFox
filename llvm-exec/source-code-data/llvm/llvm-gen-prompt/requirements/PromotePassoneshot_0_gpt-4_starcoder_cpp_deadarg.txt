The C code should contain the following pattern:

```c
int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    int z = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable z

    int *p = (int*)malloc(sizeof(int)); // allocate memory for an integer
    *p = x + y + z; // assign the sum of x, y, and z to the allocated memory

    int result = *p; // read the value from the allocated memory
    free(p); // deallocate the memory

    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the `main` function, there exists an allocation of memory (`malloc`), assignment of a value to the allocated memory (`*p = x + y + z;`), reading of the value from the allocated memory (`int result = *p;`), and deallocation of the memory (`free(p);`). The `main` function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison. 

The key point here is the use of a pointer to allocate memory, assign a value, read the value, and then deallocate the memory. This pattern will trigger the `PromotePass` optimization in LLVM, which promotes memory to register.
