### Please generate a valid C program that meets the requirements below. The program should contain a `main` function that returns an integer value. Please initialize all variables you define with a value. Please do not include any undefined behavior in your code. The code you generate will be used to test the correctness of the optimization.

# Description of requirements

The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
// Template for instruction combining
int function_with_combinable_instructions(int x) {
    // Instructions that could be combined
    int temp = x + 5;
    int result = temp * 2;  // Could be combined with the previous instruction
    
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int result = function_with_combinable_instructions(x);
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where multiple instructions can be combined into fewer, more efficient instructions
