### Please generate a valid C program that meets the requirements below. The program should contain a `main` function that returns an integer value. Please initialize all variables you define with a value. Please do not include any undefined behavior in your code. The code you generate will be used to test the correctness of the optimization.

# Description of requirements

The C program should contain the following pattern:

```c
// Template for reassociation
int function_with_reassociable_ops(int a, int b, int c) {
    // Operations that could be reassociated for better optimization
    return a + (b + c);  // Could be reassociated as (a + b) + c
}

int main() {
    int x = 10;
    int y = 20;
    int z = 30;
    int result = function_with_reassociable_ops(x, y, z);
    return result;
}
```

This pattern characterizes scenarios where arithmetic operations can be reassociated to enable better constant folding or other optimizations
