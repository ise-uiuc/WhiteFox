The C code should contain the following pattern:

```c
// define a function that performs some operations and returns a value
int func(int x, int y) {
    int result = x OPERATOR y; // result is related to x and y
    return result;
}

int main() {
    int x = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable x
    int y = ANY_VALUE; // declare variable y
    // invoke the func
    int result = func(x, y);
    // perform a truncation operation on the result
    short truncated_result = (short)(result);
    return truncated_result;
}
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where within the main function, there exists a call to func, and the result of this call is being used. func is a function that accepts two integer arguments, performs some operation on them, and returns an integer result. The main function then performs a truncation operation on this result, converting it to a short type. The main function must return a value related to this optimization for further comparison.
