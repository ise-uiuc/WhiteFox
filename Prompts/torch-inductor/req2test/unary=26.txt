### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise convolution with kernel size 1 to the input tensor
t2 = t1 * 0.5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.5
t3 = t1 * 0.7071067811865476 # Multiply the output of the convolution by 0.7071067811865476
t4 = torch.erf(t3) # Apply the error function to the output of the convolution
t5 = t4 + 1 # Add 1 to the output of the error function
t6 = t2 * t5 # Multiply the output of the convolution by the output of the error function
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where the output of a pointwise convolution is multiplied by a constant `0.5`, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by another constant `0.7071067811865476`, and then the error function is applied to the output of the convolution, and then `1` is added to the output of the error function, and then the output of the convolution is multiplied by the output of the error function.

# Model
class Model(torch.nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv = torch.nn.Conv2d(3, 8, 1, stride=1, padding=1)
 
    def forward(self, x1):
        v1 = self.conv(x1)
        v2 = v1 * 0.5
        v3 = v1 * 0.7071067811865476
        v4 = torch.erf(v3)
        v5 = v4 + 1
        v6 = v2 * v5
        return v6

# Initializing the model
m = Model()

# Inputs to the model
x1 = torch.randn(1, 3, 64, 64)
__output__ = m(x1)

### Please generate a valid PyTorch model example with public PyTorch APIs meets the specified requirements. Plus, please also generate the input tensor for the newly generated model. The model should be different from the previous one.

# Description of requirements
The model should contain the following pattern:
```
t1 = conv_transpose(input_tensor) # Apply pointwise transposed convolution to the input tensor
t2 = t1 > 0 # Create a mask where each element is True if the corresponding element in t1 is greater than 0, False otherwise
t3 = t1 * negative_slope # Multiply the output of the transposed convolution by the negative slope
t4 = torch.where(t2, t1, t3) # Apply the where function to select elements from t1 or t3 based on the mask t2
```
This pattern characterizes scenarios where a pointwise transposed convolution is applied to an input tensor, then a mask is created based on whether each element in the output of the convolution is greater than `0`. The output of the convolution is then multiplied by a negative slope. The `torch.where` function is used to select elements from the output of the convolution or the result of the multiplication based on the mask. This is a typical pattern for a Leaky ReLU operation following a transposed convolution.
